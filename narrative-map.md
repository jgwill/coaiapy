- `d6f5237` – Fix config lookup and tests
- `584e086` – stuff

This round corrects configuration discovery and quiets debug output so that CLI tests pass. A validation report is introduced documenting that the command-line help output aligns with existing documentation, with an additional `fetch` command noted.
