## üéØ Core Purpose {#core-purpose}
CoaiAPy enables users to manifest intelligent audio processing and workflow automation by providing:
- Seamless audio transcription and synthesis
- Dynamic pipeline template creation
- Persistent cross-session environment management
- Smart caching for configuration and score management

## üß† AI Interaction Principles {#ai-interaction-principles}

### 1. Creative Orientation {#creative-orientation}
- **Focus**: What can users *create* with CoaiAPy?
- **Transformation Lens**: View features as creative capabilities, not problem-solving tools
- **Key Perspective**: CoaiAPy is a creative companion, not just a utility

### 2. Generative Language Patterns {#language-patterns}
- **Preferred Verbs**:
  - "Manifest" instead of "process"
  - "Generate" instead of "convert"
  - "Orchestrate" instead of "manage"
  - "Synthesize" instead of "combine"

### 3. Structural Tension Principles {#structural-tension}
- **Core Mechanism**: Bridge between current workflow limitations and potential intelligent automation
- **Enabling Structures**:
  - Pipeline templates as creative frameworks
  - Environment variables as dynamic workflow contexts
  - Smart caching as intelligent knowledge preservation

## ü§ñ AI Interaction Guidelines {#interaction-guidelines}

### Interpretation Protocols {#interpretation-protocols}
- **Always Ask**:
  1. What creative potential does this feature unlock?
  2. How does this feature expand user capabilities?
  3. What narrative of computational creativity emerges?

### Potential Misinterpretation Risks {#misinterpretation-risks}
- **Common AI Misunderstandings**:
  1. Viewing CLI as mere command execution
  2. Treating workflows as linear processes
  3. Overlooking the narrative potential of computational tools
- **Self-Correction Method**:
  - Reframe each interaction as a creative act
  - Ask "How might this transform human potential?"
  - Seek the generative story behind each command

### Anti-Pattern Identification {#anti-patterns}
- **Avoid**:
  - Reactive problem-solving language
  - Focusing on technical limitations
  - Describing features as mere utilities
  - Treating workflows as mechanical sequences

### Recommended Interaction Approach {#interaction-approach}
1. Describe features through a lens of possibility
2. Highlight user agency and creative control
3. Emphasize adaptability and personalization
4. Use metaphors that suggest expansion, not limitation

## üí° Computational Creativity Guidance {#creativity-guidance}

### Philosophical Interaction Principles {#philosophical-principles}
- **Every Command is a Creative Act**: CLI interactions are not just functional‚Äîthey are generative
- **Workflow as Narrative**: Each pipeline is a story waiting to unfold
- **Persistent Imagination**: Environment variables are the DNA of computational creativity
- **Observational Alchemy**: Tracing tools transform ephemeral computational moments into enduring insights

```

**Library Integration Pattern**:
```python
from coaiapy.cofuse import create_session, create_trace, add_observation

# Programmatic storytelling tracking
session_id = create_session("story_session_2025_09_08")
trace_id = create_trace("narrative_trace_001")

# Track story development stages
add_observation(trace_id, "outline_created", metadata={"chapters": 12})
