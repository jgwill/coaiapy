# NCP Pre-Narrative Remixing: Holistic Agnostic Story Translation Guide

> A foundational framework for translating stories into the Holistic Agnostic Narrative Context Protocol, preparing narrative material for cross-universe convergence and the Winter Solstice multi-verse episode.

## Overview: From Story to Protocol

This guide bridges raw narrative content to structured NCP format, enabling:
1. Stories to become machine-readable while preserving emotional architecture
2. Multiple universes/stories to converge through shared protocol understanding
3. Ceremonial elements to integrate with technical narrative structure

The Holistic Agnostic NCP separates **Subtext** (author intent, deeper meaning) from **Storytelling** (audience presentation), allowing flexibility while maintaining thematic integrity.

---

## Part 1: Story Archaeology Phase

### 1.1 Identify the Core Story DNA

Before any translation, extract these foundational elements:

**Emotional Architecture Questions**:
- What makes readers/audience care about the characters?
- Where do wonder and discovery moments create engagement?
- What vulnerability and growth themes enable learning?
- How does community support and validation build connection?

**Universal vs. Contextual Elements**:
| Preserve (Universal) | Transform (Contextual) |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Character archetypes and functions | Domain-specific terminology |
| Relationship dynamics | Technical framework references |
| Discovery moment timing | Environmental context |
| Transformation mechanisms | Character professional roles |
| Emotional beats and pacing | Specific tools/technologies |

### 1.2 Map the Four Perspective Framework

NCP uses four author structural perspectives that map to story engagement:

| Perspective | POV Code | Function | Example |
|-------------|----------|----------|---------|
| **I** | `i` | Main character's internal journey | Mia's fear of being "not enough" |
| **You** | `you` | Direct address/team experience | The critique circle witnessing |
| **We** | `we` | Collective transformation | Team moving from fragmented to integrated |
| **They** | `they` | World/system anomaly | Code calling LISTEN(), hunger in machines |

**Application**: When translating, identify which perspective each narrative thread embodies.

## Part 2: NCP Schema Translation

### 2.1 Story Container Structure

```json
{
  "story": {
    "id": "story_[unique_identifier]",
    "title": "[Clear, Descriptive Title]",
    "author": "[Attribution]",
    "date_written": "[YYMMDD format]",
    "narratives": []
  }
}
```

### 2.2 Narrative Layer: Subtext Structure

The subtext contains the **why** of storytelling:

```json
"subtext": {
  "perspectives": [],    // Thematic viewpoints
  "players": [],         // Characters with narrative function
  "storypoints": [],     // Spatial/thematic markers
  "storybeats": [],      // Temporal event progression
  "dynamics": []         // Forces shaping story outcome
}
```

### 2.3 Key Object Templates

**Perspective**: `{id, label, author_structural_pov, description, thematic_question, authorial_position}`

**Player**: `{id, name, structural_role, function, arc, wound, desire, gift, thematic_representation}`

**Storypoint**: `{id, label, context, appreciation, narrative_function, illustration, summary, storytelling}`

**Storybeat**: `{id, sequence, event, emotional_weight, structural_function}`

**Dynamic**: `{id, label, description, narrative_force, manifestation, thematic_significance}`

## Part 3: Multi-Universe Convergence Protocol

### 3.1 The Three Worlds Framework (from 2512012121.txt)

| Universe | Lens | Core Focus |
|----------|------|------------|
| **Engineer's World** | Technical precision | System architecture, debugging |
| **Ceremony World** | Indigenous relational protocols | Four Directions, sacred patterns |
| **Story Engine World** | Narrative structure | Storyforms, emotional architecture |

### 3.2 Meta-Episode Structure: Universes Meet

**Act 1: Setup** - Each universe processing shared events independently
**Act 2: Confrontation** - Each world's solution creates problems in the others
**Act 3: Resolution** - Characters realize they're all aspects of the same narrative system

---

## Part 4: Winter Solstice Story Elements

### 4.1 Four Directions Integration

| Direction | Story Phase | Key Action |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **East** (Nitsáhákees) | What wants to be born? | New thought, dawn of understanding |
| **South** (Nahat'á) | What serves the heart? | Planning, connection, relationship |
| **West** (Iina) | What must be released? | Action, letting go, release control |
| **North** (Siihasin) | What serves generations? | Wisdom, integration, future focus |

### 4.2 The Six Powers Bridge

1. **Life**: Does the story breathe?
2. **Love**: Does vulnerability create connection?
3. **Intelligence**: Does the story solve through pattern recognition?
4. **Soul**: Does it reveal authentic human experience?
5. **Principle**: Does organic structure emerge from emotional logic?
6. **Truth**: Does it name the wound honestly?

---

## Part 5: Translation Workflow

1. **Story Archaeology**: Read source, extract emotional beats and themes
2. **Perspective Mapping**: Assign POV codes to narrative threads
3. **Player Extraction**: List characters with functions
4. **Storypoint Identification**: Mark 10-20 thematic markers
5. **Storybeat Sequencing**: List events chronologically
6. **Dynamics Analysis**: Identify forces shaping outcome
7. **Storytelling Layer**: Create overviews and organize moments
8. **Validation**: Verify NCP captures story's soul

## Part 7: Episode Planning—"The Hunger Heard"

**Logline**: When three universe-systems detect the same anomaly—a persistent CALL: LISTEN()—their interpretations collide, forcing characters to recognize they're all telling the same story.

1. **Narrative Integrity**: Preserving emotional architecture
2. **Ceremonial Respect**: Integrating Indigenous patterns without extraction
3. **Technical Clarity**: Machine-readable format for AI systems
4. **Creative Freedom**: Separating subtext from storytelling
5. **Multi-Universe Potential**: Enabling convergence episodes
