# Validation Report

This repository contains the `coaia` CLI which exposes multiple subcommands. The provided help text in the issue was compared against the actual help output from `python -m coaiapy.coaiacli` after fixing minor errors.

## Summary of Checks

- Base `--help` output lists the following commands:
  - `tash` (`m`)
  - `transcribe` (`t`)
  - `summarize` (`s`)
  - `p`
  - `init`
  - `fuse`
  - `fetch` (additional command not present in the issue help)
- Each subcommand's help matches the arguments and options shown in the issue snippet.
- Unit tests in `coaiapy/test_cli_fetch.py` pass after addressing a syntax error and removing a debug print in `_newjtaler`.

The codebase corresponds to the CLI usage documentation with the exception of an extra `fetch` command.
